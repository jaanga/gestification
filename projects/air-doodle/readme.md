These objects do not distract. AirDoodles appear only when you want them to appear.

Who loves it when people want things to appear? Teachers, advertisers and search engines...

An AirDoodle:

* Does not interfere with regular content
* Only appears when you want it to appear
* Only loads well if you have the appropriate hardware
* And you really want the airDoodle to appear - even if only for a brief moment - because you have not seen what's there yet...
